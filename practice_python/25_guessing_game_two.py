# In a previous exercise, we‚Äôve written a program that ‚Äúknows‚Äù a number and asks a user to guess it.

# This time, we‚Äôre going to do exactly the opposite.
# You, the user, will have in your head a number between 0 and 100.
# The program will guess a number, and you, the user, will say whether it is too high, too low, or your number.

# At the end of this exchange, your program should print out how many guesses it took to get your number.

# As the writer of this program, you will have to choose how your program will strategically guess.
# A naive strategy can be to simply start the guessing at 1, and keep going (2, 3, 4, etc.) until you hit the number.
# But that‚Äôs not an optimal guessing strategy.
# An alternate strategy might be to guess 50 (right in the middle of the range), and then increase / decrease by 1 as needed.
# After you‚Äôve written the program, try to find the optimal strategy!
# (We‚Äôll talk about what is the optimal one next week with the solution.)
