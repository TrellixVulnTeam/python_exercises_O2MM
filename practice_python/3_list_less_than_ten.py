# Take a list, say for example this one:

#  a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]
# and write a program that prints out all the elements of the list that are less than 5.

# Extras:

# Instead of printing the elements one by one, make a new list that has all the elements less than 5 from this list in it and print out this new list.
# Write this in one line of Python.
# Ask the user for a number and return a list that contains only elements from the original list a that are smaller than that number given by the user.

a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]

less_than = int(input('Give my a number: '))

print(
    f'The numbers in list "a" that are less than {less_than} are {[num for num in a if num < less_than]}')
